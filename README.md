Summary of Findings
The core finding from this analysis is that password length is the single most critical factor in determining its strength.

Weak Passwords (e.g., password, 12345678) scored below 10% and are considered extremely insecure as they are predictable and short.

Moderate Passwords (e.g., P@ssword, Soccer@10) showed improved scores by adding complexity, but their reliance on common words and shorter length still makes them vulnerable.

Very Strong Passwords (e.g., Blu3-Sk!es-F0rever) consistently scored 100%. Their strength comes from a combination of significant length (15+ characters) and high complexity (using all four character types).

The experiment clearly demonstrates that a long, complex passphrase is exponentially more secure than a short password with simple substitutions.

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Based on the findings, the following practices should always be followed to ensure strong password security:

Prioritize Length: Make your passwords at least 12-15 characters long. Longer is always better.

Use Complexity: Combine a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (!@#$%^&*).

Avoid Predictability: Do not use common words, your name, birthdays, or sequential numbers (abc, 123). Your password should be random and unpredictable.

Create Passphrases: Instead of a complex but short password, create a long passphrase of multiple words. For example, Four-Angry-Trees-Sing2Loudly is both easier to remember and stronger than Aj7$kL9*.

Use a Password Manager: Use a trusted password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for every online account.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Wherever possible, enable MFA. It provides a critical layer of security that protects your account even if your password is stolen.
